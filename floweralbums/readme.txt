Photo Album Information:
------------------------
1. Getting Started:  On a computer running Windows the CD will "autorun" and open up the file "index.html" using the default internet browser (Internet Explorer in most cases).  If the autorun feature does not work you can open up photo albums by double-clicking on the file "index.html", first using your "My Computer" icon and then clicking on the CD-drive.

2. Navigation:  You use the mouse to navigate through the photo album.  The main page allows you to choose from one of the 13 albums or the "special features" section which contains a couple of newspaper articles.  Once in a particular photo album, you can use the "Cover" link to return to the cover page (which has a link to the "Main Menu") or the "Contents" link to go to the table of contents, which lists page by page captions of all the photos in that album.  You can also jump through the albums using the 5-page increments at the bottom of the album.

3. Table of Contents:  You can jump to a particular page in the album by clicking on the page number at the left of the table of contents.  From the cover page of an album you can get to the table of contents by clicking on the "Table of Contents" link.

4. Viewing/Printing Individual Photos:  You can click on any picture in the album to view it by itself and at its full size.  This is the best way to print any picture from the album, as it will adjust the font color of the caption for printing and make sure that full size is used for printing (hopefully on one page).  You can also save the images to your harddrive by using the right-click option on the picture.

5. Reverse-sides of Photos:  Some of the photos have interesting information on the reverse side.  These photos are indicated with an * at the end of the caption.  To view the reverse side you simply hold the mouse pointer over the caption text.  There are a few postcards where this is particularly interesting. (When viewing the picture alone, you can actually toggle between the front and reverse sides by clicking on the caption.)
