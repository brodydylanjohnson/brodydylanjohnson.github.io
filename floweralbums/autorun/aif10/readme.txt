Purpose of Autorun Inf Editor
The Autorun.inf Editor is a program that can be used to quickly and easily create autorun CD autorun.inf files. An autorun.inf file is a required file when creating an autorun CD. When a CD is put into the drive, the operating system looks for the autorun.inf file. If the file exists, it reads the file and then knows how to "autoplay" the CD. There are a number of things you can do with an autorun.inf file. For more information on autorun.inf files click here.

The Autorun.inf Editor was created as a free utility to make it easy for people to generate their own autorun.inf files. With the editor you can create an autorun.inf file that can:

-Set a label for the CD (this label will be displayed in My Computer and Explorer on a Windows computer)
-Set an icon for the CD
-Specify a program on the CD (or user's computer) to run when the CD is inserted
-Add entries and commands to the context menu for when a user right-clicks on the CD
